# Vinyl Search

I recently was gifted a vintage record player and have started buying vinyl records for my collection. I often wish I could sample some songs before buying the record so I created a solution! I created an app that allows users to take a picture of an album and listen to some tracks before buying. Like Shazam but for album covers. Leveraging the Google Vision api and the Spotify api  I created a FastAPI backend and deployed it to google cloud. I used Flutter on the frontend.  In order to better understand how image recognition works I wrote a small script that detects albums using  Python and  Machine learning through OpenCV library.
